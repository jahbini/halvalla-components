# Halvalla components forked from RiotGear2.

This is an update of the excellent RiotGear components that are Blaze CSS v1.0 compatible. We've updated them to Blaze CSS v2 and are adding the other new Blaze components like ranges, inputs, addresses, etc. All the existing original RiotGear compoents are already updated to Blaze 2.

## Forked RiotGear
The orginal RG implementation is based on Blaze CSS 1.x. Many users in the community are using Blaze CSS 2.x, which breaks RG.
